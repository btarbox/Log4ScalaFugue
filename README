Log4JFugue is a Java based system for converting any program's log file output to music.

It has recently been rewritten into Scala and lives on GitHub.
The original Java sources can be found at www.log4jfugue.org.

Recent additions to the system include a DataGetter for a MongoDB.  This uses configurable
column names so it should work with any Mongo database that includes timestamp and
message columns.

It also a very rudimentary Swing base GUI that allows a user to select a log file
for processing.  Need to add the ability to stop the processing of a log file.

Have also written a method to process the statistics about a log file so as to see
which log messages are most frequent.  Need to hook that into the GUI.

Also on the wishlist is the ability to scale message frequency.  Some messages occur 50 or
more times a second.  Since we can only handle counts between 0 and 16 we lose the ability]
to distinguish changes in value.  We would like to be able to take each second's message
count and scale it down by a configurable value.
